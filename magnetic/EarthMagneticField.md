# The Earth's Magnetic Field (Beta test)

## 1. The Main Field

The Eath's magnetic field is predominantly that of a magnetic dipole such as that produced by a sphere of uniform magnetization or a current loop. The strength of the dipole was $7.96\times10^{15} \ [Wb \cdot m]$ in 1975. The "South" end of the dipole was in the northern hemisphere at $78.60^{\circ}$ N latitude and $289.55^{\circ}$ E longitude and drifting westward at about 0.014 deg/year. The dipole strength is decreasing by 0.05%/year. This drift implies that the field can be reverse in several thousand of years. There are evidence of reversalsin the past with time scale of 70,000 to 100,000 years between reversals.

The plane perpendicular to the Earth-centered dipole is called the magnetic equator.
